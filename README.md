<h1>Breast Cancer Analysis</h1>

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and improving survival rates. This project involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the development of a predictive model using the FastAI library to classify breast cancer.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

This repository contains the code and resources for:
<ul>
